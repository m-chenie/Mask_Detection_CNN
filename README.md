# Mask Detection CNN Model
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict if a person in an image is wearing a mask or not. The model can be used for automated mask detection in various applications, such as public health monitoring, security systems, and compliance with safety guidelines.

# Dataset
Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset

The dataset is divided into two classes: "with_mask" and "without_mask". The images are labelled accordingly to train the CNN model.
The dataset used for this project is available in the data directory. It consists of two subdirectories: with_mask and without_mask, containing the respective image samples.
The label for an image are either 0 (not wearing a mask) or 1 (wearing a mask)

# Results
Accuracy of 91.9%
